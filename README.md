# Energy Sector Cybersecurity RAG Assistant

This project is a local question-answering application for energy-sector cybersecurity research. It helps users ask plain-English questions about critical infrastructure cybersecurity and receive answers grounded in a document collection.

The application is built with Python, Streamlit, OpenAI, and Pinecone. In simple terms:

- Python runs the application.
- Streamlit provides the browser-based chat screen.
- OpenAI turns questions and documents into searchable meaning and writes the final answer.
- Pinecone stores searchable document chunks.

## Who This Is For

This project is for:

- Energy-sector cybersecurity analysts.
- Utility security and compliance teams.
- Policy researchers working with NERC, NIST, CISA, DOE, FERC, and OT/ICS guidance.
- Developers maintaining a retrieval-augmented generation system.

It is not a general chatbot. It is designed for grounded analysis over critical infrastructure and energy-sector cybersecurity documents.

## What It Can Do

- Answer questions about energy-sector cybersecurity risks.
- Retrieve evidence from local PDF-derived text chunks.
- Cite the source documents used for an answer.
- Group findings by cybersecurity control family.
- Draft policy recommendations and action plans.
- Refresh the knowledge base with selected web sources.
- Run through a browser interface or a command-line script.

## Quick Start

These steps assume you have just downloaded the repository and want to run the app on your own computer.

### 1. Install Python

Python is the program that runs this project.

Install Python 3.10 or newer. The repository has been used with Python 3.13, based on the local virtual environment.

Check your version:

```bash
python --version
```

What this does: prints the Python version installed on your computer.

Expected output:

```text
Python 3.x.x
```

If the command is not found, install Python and try again.

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

A virtual environment is a private folder for this project's Python libraries. It keeps this project separate from other Python projects on your computer.

On macOS or Linux:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

On Windows:

```powershell
python -m venv venv
```

What this does: creates a folder named `venv/`.

Expected output: usually no text appears. That is normal.

### 3. Turn On the Virtual Environment

On macOS or Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

What this does: tells your terminal to use this project's private Python setup.

Expected output: your terminal prompt may show `(venv)`.

### 4. Install the Project Libraries

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

What this does: downloads the Python libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.

Why it matters: the application cannot run until these libraries are installed.

Expected output: many lines ending with a success message.

Common error: if you see `pip: command not found`, try:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Create Your `.env` File

An environment variable is a setting the app reads when it starts. A `.env` file is a simple text file that stores these settings.

Create a file named `.env` in the project root:

```text
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key_here
PINECONE_INDEX=energy-cyber-index
PINECONE_CLOUD=aws
PINECONE_REGION=us-east-1
OPENAI_EMBED_MODEL=text-embedding-3-small
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4.1-mini
```

Do not share your `.env` file. It contains secret keys.

### 6. Build the Local Corpus

The repository includes PDF files in `data/pdf/`. This command extracts text from them and creates a searchable text file.

```bash
python -m scripts.02_prepare_energy_json
```

What this does: reads PDFs and writes `data/critical_infra_corpus.jsonl`.

Expected output: lines that begin with `Processing:` and end with `Done!`.

### 7. Upload the Corpus to Pinecone

Pinecone is the searchable memory for the app.

```bash
python -m scripts.03_index_pinecone --chunks data/critical_infra_corpus.jsonl --reset
```

What this does: turns each text chunk into a searchable vector and stores it in Pinecone.

Why it matters: without this step, the app may fall back to a slower local search or return weaker answers.

Expected output: progress bars and `Indexing complete`.

Warning: `--reset` deletes the existing contents of the selected Pinecone index before uploading the current corpus.

### 8. Start the Browser App

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

What this does: starts the web interface on your computer.

Expected output: Streamlit prints a local address, usually:

```text
Local URL: http://localhost:8501
```

Open that address in your browser.

## Running the Project

### Development

Use development mode when you are editing or testing the project locally.

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

Expected result: the browser app opens and lets you ask questions.

### Command-Line Query

Use this when you want a JSON answer in the terminal.

```bash
python -m scripts.04_query_bot --q "What are NERC CIP access control requirements?"
```

Add debug information:

```bash
python -m scripts.04_query_bot --q "How should incident response be handled in OT systems?" --debug
```

### Testing and Evaluation

This repository does not include a separate unit test suite. It does include an evaluation script that checks sample grounded responses.

```bash
python -m scripts.05_eval_grounding
```

What this does: runs several sample questions and writes results to `data/eval_results.jsonl`.

Expected output: `[PASS]` lines or a list of failed checks.

### Production

TODO: Information could not be determined automatically.

No production deployment files, process manager files, container files, or cloud deployment configuration were found in the repository.

## Common Tasks

### Rebuild the corpus from PDFs

```bash
python -m scripts.02_prepare_energy_json
```

Use this after adding or removing PDF files in `data/pdf/`.

### Re-upload the corpus to Pinecone

```bash
python -m scripts.03_index_pinecone --chunks data/critical_infra_corpus.jsonl --reset
```

Use this after rebuilding the corpus.

### Add web sources to Pinecone

```bash
python -m scripts.06_ingest_web_sources --url https://example.gov/example-page
```

Use this when you have a specific source URL to ingest.

Preview without writing to Pinecone:

```bash
python -m scripts.06_ingest_web_sources --dry-run
```

### Ask a question in the terminal

```bash
python -m scripts.04_query_bot --q "What are common attack vectors against energy-sector ICS?"
```

### Restart the app

Stop Streamlit with `Control+C`, then run:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

## Troubleshooting

### `Missing env var: OPENAI_API_KEY`

Cause: the app cannot find your OpenAI key.

Fix: create or update `.env` and include:

```text
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

Verification: restart the app and ask a question.

### `Missing OPENAI_API_KEY or PINECONE_API_KEY`

Cause: the indexing script needs both keys.

Fix: add both values to `.env`.

Verification:

```bash
python -m scripts.03_index_pinecone --chunks data/critical_infra_corpus.jsonl
```

### `No module named app`

Cause: the script was run as a file path instead of a Python module.

Fix: run scripts with `python -m`.

Use:

```bash
python -m scripts.04_query_bot --q "test question"
```

Avoid:

```bash
python scripts/04_query_bot.py
```

### Empty or weak answers

Likely causes:

- The Pinecone index is empty.
- `PINECONE_INDEX` points to the wrong index.
- The corpus was not rebuilt after PDF changes.
- The question does not match the available documents.

Fix:

```bash
python -m scripts.02_prepare_energy_json
python -m scripts.03_index_pinecone --chunks data/critical_infra_corpus.jsonl --reset
```

## FAQ

### What is RAG?

RAG means retrieval-augmented generation. In plain English, the app first searches documents, then asks an AI model to answer using those documents.

### Where is my data stored?

The local source documents are in `data/pdf/`. Extracted text is in `data/critical_infra_corpus.jsonl`. Search vectors are stored in Pinecone.

### Does this app have user accounts?

No. No login, roles, or user account system was found in this repository.

### Does this app have an API?

No HTTP API endpoints were found. The app is used through Streamlit or command-line scripts.

### Is there a database?

There is no traditional database. The project uses local files and Pinecone.

### Can I use it without Pinecone?

Partly. The code can fall back to local keyword retrieval if Pinecone access fails, but Pinecone is required for the intended vector search workflow.
